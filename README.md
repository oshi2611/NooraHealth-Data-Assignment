# NooraHealth-Data-Assignment

# Noora Health - Data Engineering Pipeline

## 1. Project Overview
This project processes **WhatsApp chat data** from Noora Health's **Remote Engagement Service**. The pipeline involves:
- Extracting raw data from Google Sheets
- Loading it into **BigQuery**
- Transforming it for analytics
- Validating data quality
- Creating interactive visualizations

## 2. Setup & Prerequisites
### Required Tools
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** with **BigQuery enabled**
- SQL (for transformations)
- PowerBI (for visualization)


## 3. Data Ingestion (Extract & Load)
### Upload Data to BigQuery
1. **Download as CSV from Google Sheets**
2. **Upload to BigQuery** using:
   - BigQuery UI

## 4. Data Transformation
### Goal: Create a `final_messages` table
We merged `messages` and `statuses` tables to have **one row per message**.

SQL Query used to merge the 2 tables based on the message ID
```SQL
SELECT 
    m.id AS message_id, 
    m.message_type, 
    m.masked_addressees, 
    m.masked_author, 
    m.content, 
    m.author_type, 
    m.direction, 
    m.external_id, 
    m.external_timestamp, 
    m.masked_from_addr, 
    m.is_deleted, 
    m.last_status, 
    m.last_status_timestamp, 
    m.rendered_content, 
    m.source_type, 
    m.uuid AS message_uuid, 
    m.inserted_at AS inserted_at_x, 
    m.updated_at AS updated_at_x, 
    s.id AS status_id, 
    s.status, 
    s.timestamp, 
    s.message_uuid, 
    s.number_id, 
    s.inserted_at AS inserted_at_y, 
    s.updated_at AS updated_at_y
FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.messages_final` m
LEFT JOIN `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.statuses` s 
ON m.id = s.message_id;
```
The merged csv is uploaded as merged_messages.csv


## 5. Data Validation :
   i. Detect Duplicate Messages. (Consistency)
  ii. Check for missing critical fields. (Completeness)
 iii. Verify Status Upadate for messages. (Quality)

### SQL Queries Used
#### Consistency
```sql
WITH DuplicateRecords AS (
    SELECT 
        id, 
        content, 
        inserted_at,
        LAG(inserted_at) OVER (PARTITION BY content ORDER BY inserted_at) AS prev_inserted_at
    FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
)
SELECT 
    id, 
    content, 
    inserted_at,
    CASE 
        WHEN prev_inserted_at IS NOT NULL 
             AND ABS(strftime('%s', inserted_at) - strftime('%s', prev_inserted_at)) <= 60 
        THEN 'Duplicate' 
        ELSE 'Unique' 
    END AS flag
FROM DuplicateRecords;
```
The flagged csv is uploaded as flagged_messages.csv 

### Completeness
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS missing_records 
FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
WHERE content IS NULL 
   OR inserted_at_x IS NULL 
   OR status IS NULL;
```
### Quality
```sql
SELECT message_id, COUNT(DISTINCT status) AS unique_status_count
FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
GROUP BY message_id
HAVING unique_status_count > 1;
```

Here are the results of the data validation checks:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Critical Fields (Completeness): üö® 32,158 records have missing values in either content, inserted_at_x, or status.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Duplicate Messages (Consistency): ‚ö†Ô∏è 1,577 records have identical content with timestamps within 1 minute.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Conflicting Status Updates (Quality): ‚ùó 11,578 messages have multiple conflicting statuses.

These indicate potential data quality issues. And so a cleaned_messages csv was generated using following queries

SQL query used for cleansing the data 
```sql
DELETE FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
WHERE content IS NULL 
   OR inserted_at_x IS NULL 
   OR status IS NULL;
```

```sql
WITH DuplicateCheck AS (
    SELECT 
        id_x, 
        content, 
        inserted_at_x, 
        LEAD(inserted_at_x) OVER (PARTITION BY content ORDER BY inserted_at_x) AS next_inserted_at
    FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
)
DELETE FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
WHERE id_x IN (
    SELECT id_x FROM DuplicateCheck 
    WHERE next_inserted_at IS NOT NULL 
      AND ABS(strftime('%s', inserted_at_x) - strftime('%s', next_inserted_at)) <= 60
);

```
```sql
WITH RankedMessages AS (
    SELECT 
        id_x, 
        status, 
        inserted_at_x,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id_x ORDER BY inserted_at_x DESC) AS rank
    FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
)
DELETE FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
WHERE id_x IN (
    SELECT id_x FROM RankedMessages WHERE rank > 1
);
```
The cleaned csv is uploaded as cleaned_messages.csv 

## 6. Data Visualization
### Steps to Create Dashboard
1. **Go to Power BI**
2. **Connect BigQuery dataset**
3. **Create Line Chart for weekly user trends**
4. **Create Pie Chart for Read and Unread message %**
5. **Create Bar Chart for message status**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Total & Active Users Over Time ‚Äì Weekly trend for the last 3 months.
