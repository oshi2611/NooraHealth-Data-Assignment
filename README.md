# NooraHealth-Data-Assignment

# Noora Health - Data Engineering Pipeline

## 1. Project Overview
This project processes **WhatsApp chat data** from Noora Health's **Remote Engagement Service**. The pipeline involves:
- Extracting raw data from Google Sheets
- Loading it into **BigQuery**
- Transforming it for analytics
- Validating data quality
- Creating interactive visualizations

## 2. Setup & Prerequisites
### Required Tools
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** with **BigQuery enabled**
- SQL (for transformations)
- PowerBI (for visualization)

## 3. Data Ingestion (Extract & Load)
### Upload Data to BigQuery
1. **Download as CSV from Google Sheets**
2. **Upload to BigQuery** using:
   - BigQuery UI

## 4. Data Transformation
### Goal: Create a `combined_messages` table
We merged `messages` and `statuses` tables to have **one row per message**.

SQL Query used to merge the 2 tables based on the message ID:
```sql
SELECT
    m.id AS message_id,
    m.message_type,
    m.masked_addressees,
    m.masked_author,
    m.content,
    m.author_type,
    m.direction,
    m.external_id,
    m.external_timestamp,
    m.masked_from_addr,
    m.is_deleted,
    m.last_status,
    m.last_status_timestamp,
    m.rendered_content,
    m.source_type,
    m.uuid AS message_uuid,
    m.inserted_at AS inserted_at_x,
    m.updated_at AS updated_at_x,
    s.id AS status_id,
    s.status,
    s.timestamp,
    s.message_uuid,
    s.number_id,
    s.inserted_at AS inserted_at_y,
    s.updated_at AS updated_at_y
FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.messages_final` m
LEFT JOIN `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.statuses` s
ON m.id = s.message_id;
```
The merged CSV is uploaded as `merged_messages.csv`.

## 5. Data Validation:
   i. Detect Duplicate Messages (Consistency)
  ii. Check for missing critical fields (Completeness)
 iii. Verify Status Update for messages (Quality)

### SQL Queries Used
#### **Consistency - Detecting Duplicate Messages**
```sql
WITH DuplicateRecords AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        content,
        inserted_at,
        LAG(inserted_at) OVER (PARTITION BY content ORDER BY inserted_at) AS prev_inserted_at
    FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
)
SELECT
    id,
    content,
    inserted_at,
    CASE
        WHEN prev_inserted_at IS NOT NULL
             AND TIMESTAMP_DIFF(inserted_at, prev_inserted_at, SECOND) <= 60
        THEN 'Duplicate'
        ELSE 'Unique'
    END AS flag
FROM DuplicateRecords;
```
The flagged CSV is uploaded as `flagged_messages.csv`.

### **Completeness - Checking for Missing Critical Fields**
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS missing_records
FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
WHERE content IS NULL
   OR inserted_at_x IS NULL
   OR status IS NULL;
```

### **Quality - Identifying Conflicting Status Updates**
```sql
SELECT message_id, COUNT(DISTINCT status) AS unique_status_count
FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
GROUP BY message_id
HAVING unique_status_count > 1;
```

Here are the results of the data validation checks:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing Critical Fields (Completeness):** üö® 32,158 records have missing values in either content, inserted_at_x, or status.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Duplicate Messages (Consistency):** ‚ö†Ô∏è 1,577 records have identical content with timestamps within 1 minute.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Conflicting Status Updates (Quality):** ‚ùó 11,578 messages have multiple conflicting statuses.

These indicate potential data quality issues. A `cleaned_messages.csv` was generated using the following queries.

### **Data Cleansing Queries**
#### **Removing Incomplete Messages**
```sql
DELETE FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
WHERE content IS NULL
   OR inserted_at_x IS NULL
   OR status IS NULL;
```

#### **Removing Duplicate Messages**
```sql
DELETE FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
WHERE id_x IN (
    SELECT id_x FROM (
        SELECT
            id_x,
            content,
            inserted_at_x,
            LEAD(inserted_at_x) OVER (PARTITION BY content ORDER BY inserted_at_x) AS next_inserted_at
        FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
    )
    WHERE next_inserted_at IS NOT NULL
      AND TIMESTAMP_DIFF(next_inserted_at, inserted_at_x, SECOND) <= 60
);
```

#### **Keeping Only the Latest Status Update**
```sql
DELETE FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
WHERE id_x NOT IN (
    SELECT id_x FROM (
        SELECT
            id_x,
            status,
            inserted_at_x,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id_x ORDER BY inserted_at_x DESC) AS rank
        FROM `project-noora-health.Noora_Chat_Data.combined_messages_final`
    )
    WHERE rank = 1
);
```
The cleaned CSV is uploaded as `cleaned_messages.csv`.

## 6. Data Visualization
### Steps to Create Dashboard
1. **Go to Power BI**
2. **Connect BigQuery dataset**
3. **Create Line Chart for weekly user trends**
4. **Create Pie Chart for Read and Unread message %**
5. **Create Bar Chart for message status**

## 7. Conclusion & Future Improvements
### Summary
This project **automated data ingestion, transformation, validation, and reporting** for Noora Health.

### Future Enhancements
- **Automate the pipeline** using **Airflow**
- **Optimize query performance** using **partitioning & clustering**
- **Implement real-time data ingestion** with **Pub/Sub**
